## Project: Empirical Study of Second-Order Optimizers for Deep Learning Applications


In this project, we have studied the effect of architecture and data on SGD, L-BFGS and K-FAC optimizers with CNN and MLP for regression and classification tasks


**File description:**

    - *classification_utils.py*: Utility/helper functions for running classification experiments
    - *regression_utild.py*: Utility/helper functions for running classification experiments 
    
    - *test_classification.py*: Template file to be used for running classification experiments. Edit user options as per requirement(Line 12-25)
    - *test_regression.py*: Template file to be used for running regression experiments. Edit user options as per requirement(Line 12-25)

    - *classification_summary.csv*: CSV containing results for classification expriments
    - *regression_summary.csv*: CSV containing results for regression expriments
    
Before running experiments, download KFAC-PyTorch repository (https://github.com/alecwangcq/KFAC-Pytorch) and place it in current directory
